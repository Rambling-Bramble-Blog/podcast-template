Your repository name should be YOUR-GITHUB-USER-NAME.github.io
More about github pages can be found here: https://pages.github.com/

This is a GitHub Pages Template used for supporting a podcast.
This idea and the base code came from ChatGPT, but has been edited to actually work.
Further files have been added as examples on how to use this template.

Files in need of edits:
- everything in /_episodes
- /assets/logo.jpeg (If you change the file name or type from "logo.jpeg" you will need to make furthere edits to "".)
- _config.yml (This is where most of your information will go).
- feed.xml (iTunes Categories Only : https://podcasters.apple.com/support/1691-apple-podcasts-categories )
- index.md (This is your main page.)
- LICENSE.md (Add your specific information, but keep in mind what the audio file may be licensed under--especially if using the InternetArchive for file hosting.)

Enjoy!
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the Podcast Template for GitHub Pages: please contact rambling.bramble.blog@gmail.com or comment/message me via GitHub (I will be slow to respond, but will respond...eventually).
